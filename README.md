🕹️ How to Play

    The game starts with Player 1 (X) and then alternates turns with Player 2 (O).
    Players enter the position where they want to place their mark (X or O).
    The game checks for a win condition or a draw after every move.
    The game ends when a player wins or all grid spaces are filled.

✅ Win Conditions

    A player wins if they get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
